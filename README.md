C Programs

This collection contains several small C programs I have written while learning the C Programming language. Each file contains 
a snippet of code designed to test my understanding of the concepts I am trying to learn. There is a breakdown section in 
every .c file which breaks down the code step by step and gives an explaination of what is going on. Feel free to add in your 
own thoughts and explaintions so I and others can continue to learn.
